**Abstract:** The past few years have witnessed a surge in the number of advanced network adapters, known as **SmartNICs**, that offer additional functionalities beyond standard packet processing capabilities. These devices often feature programmable lightweight processing cores, FPGAs, and even CPU- and GPU-based platforms capable of running separate operating systems. Though primarily aimed at data center operations, such as infrastructure management, packet filtering, and I/O acceleration, SmartNICs are increasingly being explored for high-performance computing (HPC) application acceleration. 

This tutorial offers an in-depth exploration of the state-of-the-art for SmartNICs and the emerging software ecosystems supporting them. Attendees will engage in hands-on exercises to better understand how to use SmartNICs for HPC application acceleration, including MPI collective operation offloading, OpenMP remote offload, and algorithmic modifications to maximize on-board processing power. The tutorial presenters will further discuss optimizing applications to harness SmartNICs as communication accelerators in HPC systems.

Please register for Hot Interconnects to join this tutorial. Registration is free this year and includes access to the tutorials!
